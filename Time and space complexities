Time complexity :
Time complexity is how long a program function takes to process a given input.

Big Oh Notation, Ο
The notation Ο(n) is the formal way to express the upper bound of an algorithm's running time. 
It measures the worst case time complexity or the longest amount of time an algorithm can possibly take to complete.

Omega Notation, Ω
The notation Ω(n) is the formal way to express the lower bound of an algorithm's running time. 
It measures the best case time complexity or the best amount of time an algorithm can possibly take to complete.

Theta Notation, θ
The notation θ(n) is the formal way to express both the lower bound and the upper bound of an algorithm's running time.
It measures the Average case time complexity 

Space Complexity:      
Space Complexity of an algorithm is total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes
both Auxiliary space and space used by input.
Auxiliary Space is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm
