Node.js is a single-threaded application, but it can support concurrency via the concept of event and callbacks.
Every API of Node.js is asynchronous and being single-threaded, they use async function calls to maintain concurrency.
Node uses observer pattern. Node thread keeps an event loop and whenever a task gets completed, 
it fires the corresponding event which signals the event-listener function to execute
