Single thread :
single-threading is the processing of one command at a time.The opposite of single-threading is multithreading.
Multithreading :
Multithreading is mainly found in multitasking operating systems. Multithreading is a widespread programming and execution model 
that allows multiple threads to exist within the context of one process. These threads share the process's resources, 
but are able to execute independently. The threaded programming model provides developers with a useful abstraction of concurrent execution.
Multithreading can also be applied to one process to enable parallel execution on a multiprocessing system.
Multithreaded applications have the following advantages:
1.Responsiveness
2.Faster execution
3.Lower resource consumption.
4.Better system utilization.
5.Simplified sharing and communication.
6.Parallelization.
