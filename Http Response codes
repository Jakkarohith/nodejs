2)What are the different http response codes?
The response code is also known as status code.
The Status-Code element in a server response,is a 3-digit integer where the first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response 
and the last two digits do not have any categorization role.
This are of five types

1.1xx: Informational
It means the request has been received and the process is continuing.
For example:
100: Continue	Only a part of the request has been received by the server, but as long as it has not been rejected, the client should continue with the request.
101: Switching Protocols	The server switches protocol.

2.2xx: Success
It means the action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
For example:
200 OK	The request is OK.
201 Created	The request is complete, and a new resource is created .

3.3xx: Redirection
It means further action must be taken in order to complete the request.
For example:
300 Multiple Choices	A link list. The user can select a link and go to that location. Maximum five addresses  .
301 Moved Permanently	The requested page has moved to a new url .

4.4xx: Client Error
It means the request contains incorrect syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
For example:
400 Bad Request	The server did not understand the request.
401 Unauthorized	The requested page needs a username and a password.

5.5xx: Server Error
It means the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.
For example:
