Node js used asynchronous programming .
A common work for a web server is to open a file on the server and return the content to the client.
When it comes to PHP or ASP handles a file request.
Firstly it sends the task to the computer's file system and waits until the file syatem opens and then reads the file.
Next it returns the content to the client and then it would be ready to handle the next request.
When it comes to Nodejs it handles the file request in a efficent manner such that it elminates the waiting time 
In nodejs, The task is sent to the computer file system .Meanwhile the file system is opened it handles the next request.
when the file system has opened and  read the file, the server returns the content to the client.
Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.
Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming, which is very memory efficient.
