MEAN stack :
MEAN stack refers to a collection of JavaScript based technologies used to develop web applications.
MEAN is an acronym for MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and Node.js. From client to server to database, MEAN is full stack JavaScript.
MongoDB:
MongoDB is a schemaless NoSQL database system. MongoDB saves data in binary JSON format which makes it easier to pass data between
client and server.
ExpressJS:
Express is lightweight framework used to build web applications in Node. It provides a number of robust features for building single
and multi page web application. Express is inspired by the popular Ruby framework.
AngularJS:
AngularJS is a JavaScript framework developed by Google. It provides some awesome features like the two-way data binding.
It’s a complete solution for rapid and awesome front end development.
Node.js:
Node.js is a server side JavaScript execution environment.
It’s a platform built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript runtime.
It helps in building highly scalable and concurrent applications rapidly.

MERN stack :
MERN stack refers to a collection of JavaScript based technologies used to develop web applications.
MERN is an acronym for MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and Node.js. From client to server to database, MERN is full stack JavaScript.
An alternative to Angular is React, a JavaScript library developed by Facebook to build 
interactive/reactive user interfaces. Like Angular, React breaks the front-end application down into components.
Each component can hold its own state and a parent can pass its state down to its child components and those components can pass
changes back to the parent through the use of callback functions.
React is most commonly executed within the browser but it can also be run on the back-end server within Node.js,
or as a mobile app using React Native.

Angular 2 is a little more powerful while React is easier for developers to get up to speed with and use.
