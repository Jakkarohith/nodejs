A source code must be converted into a machine code by either compiler or an interpreter 
A compiler is a program which converts the source code into machine code at once. 
In case of compiler a source code after compilation generates  the executable file which could be shared to any number of users
This executable file is only understood by the computer could directly produce the result.Using complied language source code is private 
and the excetubale file is ready to run.
Whereas when it comes to interpreter the programmer writes the source code and the copy of the source code is sent to the users who has 
their own interpreter to convert the code into machine code.In interpreter, source code is public and the user who wants the output should 
have his own have interpreter,it is often slower because it must be interpretered everytime one required output and source code is public.
When it comes to advantages of interpreter it is cross platform as code is executed at the user side with his own interpreter.
