Idempotency :
Idempotency is a property where even if the same methods were called to the server, that dosen't effect the resources at the server.
Methods showing the Idempotency property are called Idempotent Methods.

Idempotent methods:
An idempotent HTTP method is a HTTP method that can be called many times without different outcomes. 
It would not matter if the method is called only once, or ten times over. The result should be the same.
1.GET:
The GET method is idempotent, as multiple calls to the GET resource will always return the same response.
2.POST:
The PUT method is idempotent, as calling the PUT method multiple times will update the same resource and not change the outcome.
3.POST:
The POST is not idempotent, and calling the POST method multiple times can have different results and will result in creating new resources.
4.DELETE:
The DELETE is idempotent because once the resource is deleted, it is gone and calling the method multiple times will not change the outcome.
