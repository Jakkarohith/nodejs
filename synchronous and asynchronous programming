Synchronous programming:
In case of synchronous programming, the program execution usually starts at the first line of the source code and each line of code executed 
sequentially.The program is executed line by line, one line at a time. Each time a function is called, program execution waits until
that function returns before continuing to the next line of code.This type of programmming is know as Synchronous programming.
Asynchronous programming:
In case of asynchronous programming, the program execution wont stop for any operation or a function to complete The result of the each
operation will be handled only once the result is available.
