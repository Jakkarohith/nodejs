Different types of OS:
Operating system: 
An Operating System performs all the basic tasks like managing file,process, and memory.(OR) 
An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides
common services for computer programs.
Types of Operating Systems:
1. Batch Operating System –
This type of operating system do not interact with the computer directly. There is an operator which takes similar jobs 
having same requirement and group them into batches.It is the responsibility of operator to sort the jobs with similar needs.
2. Time-Sharing Operating Systems –
Each task has given some time to execute, so that all the tasks work smoothly. Each user gets time of CPU as they use single 
system. These systems are also known as Multitasking Systems. The task can be from single user or from different users also. 
The time that each task gets to execute is called quantum. After this time interval is over OS switches over to next task.
3. Distributed Operating System –
A distributed operating system is a software over a collection of independent, networked, communicating, and physically 
separate computational nodes. They handle jobs which are serviced by multiple CPUs.
4. Network Operating System –
These systems runs on a server and provides the capability to manage data, users, groups, security, applications, and other 
networking functions. These type of operating systems allows shared access of files, printers, security, applications, and other 
networking functions over a small private network.
5. Real-Time Operating System –
These types of OSs serves the real-time systems. The time interval required to process and respond to inputs is very small. This time
interval is called response time.
