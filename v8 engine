v8 engine :
The V8 Engine is built by Google is an open source and written in C++. This engine is used inside Google Chrome. 
V8 is also used for the Node.js runtime.
V8 was first designed to increase the performance of JavaScript execution inside web browsers.To obtain speed, V8 translates
JavaScript code into more efficient machine code instead of using an interpreter. It compiles JavaScript code into machine code
at execution by implementing a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler.The main difference here is that V8 doesn’t produce bytecode or any 
intermediate code.
The engine uses two compilers:
Full-codegen : A simple and very fast compiler that produced simple and relatively slow machine code.
Crankshaft : A more complex (Just-In-Time)optimizing compiler that produced highly-optimized code.
